            <h3>Programmer and Web Developer</h3>

            <p>
                I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless
                information
                through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

                I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges
                with
                tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea
                of
                the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into
                the
                reading material I find interesting enough to share.

            </p>
